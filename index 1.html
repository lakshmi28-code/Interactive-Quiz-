        <div class="paragraphs">
        <p>We both are studying in Atria Institute of Technology. We are friends since when we both jumped to 2<sup>nd</sup> year. We belong to same batches during labs. We both have a very good bonding in communication. Maybe we met late but the friendship we made is memorable and valuable.</p>
        <p>We are not just classmates - we are companions in growth. Whenever one of us feels stressed or uncertain, the other is always there with encouragement and support.This balance makes our friendship feel like a partnership, where we both contribute to each other’s success and happiness.</p>
        <p>College life can be demanding, but having a good friend by your side makes the journey lighter and more meaningful. Together, we’ve created a partnership that’s not just about academics but also about growing as individuals. It’s a bond that we know will last well beyond our college years.</p>
